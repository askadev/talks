# Ask a Dev Talks

## Adding a New Talk

* File your talk `YYYY-MM-DD-__TITLE__/README.md`, with the date as the original date it was given.
* **AVOID THIS**: Include any talk-specific assets in the folder. Link everything you can to Giphy or Imgur
* If you've given a talk and make a new edit, note the date of the previous talk at the top with a link to that commit. For example:
```markdown
### Versions
* [2018 March 09](743fe1d)
```
* Every talk is licensed under the terms of the [Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) (i.e. the public domain).
* Slide notes (shown on the GitHub README but not when the Markdown is compiled) are noted like so:
```markdown
$-- Read me here, not there
```
